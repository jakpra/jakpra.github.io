Cross-linguistic Multilayer Semantic Annotation and Parsing with UCCA

These days, many NLP tasks involving meaning (such as Machine Translation and Question Answering) are trained end-to-end, under the assumption that the semantic categories and structures needed to perform the task are somehow encoded in the continuous representations of the learning architecture. 
While this trend has in fact produced significant performance jumps, the lack of interpretability and adequate evaluation metrics remains an issue. 
I want to make the case for symbolic structured meaning representations, particularly Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA; Abend & Rappoport, 2013), as a modular, anchored, and language-independent intermediary between linguistic form and abstract meaning.

In the first part of my talk, I will motivate and introduce UCCA, its main philosophy, and proposed extensions for higher-level and more fine-grained semantic layers (Prange et al., 2019; ongoing work).
The second part will touch on several techniques for automatic parsing into UCCA (Hershcovich et al. 2017, 2018, 2019; Jiang et al., 2019; ongoing work), as well as its application to text simplification (Sulem et al., 2018b) and evaluation of text-to-text generation (Birch et al., 2016; Sulem et al., 2018a; Choshen and Abend, 2018).
